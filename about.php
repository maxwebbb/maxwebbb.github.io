        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang is a mobile multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed and published by Moonton, a subsidiary of ByteDance. Released in 2016, the game grew in popularity; most prominently in Southeast Asia.[4]

At its core, the game pits 2 teams of 5 against each other in real time with at least 10-second matchmaking and 10-minute matches. Featuring traditional battle arena gameplay, players must fight over three lanes to take the enemy's tower and defend their own. Like classic MOBAs, there is no hero training to level up or pay to play angleâ€”winners and losers are decided based on skill, ability, and strategy.[5]

Following success, Moonton has tapped into the esports scene with the creation of several regional tournaments dubbed as Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Professional League (MPL) that serves as a qualifier for the Mobile Legends World Championships.[6] It was among the six games chosen for the first medal event of esports competition at the 2019 Southeast Asian Games held in the Philippines.[7]

Originally named Mobile Legends: 5v5 MOBA,[8] the initial release of the game in 2016 was met with criticism citing similarities with another MOBA game, League of Legends. As a result, Riot Games filed a lawsuit against Moonton for copyright infringement on two separate occasions: on July 2017 and May 2022.[9][10] In June 2020, the game was banned in India along with 58 other Chinese apps due to security concerns by the government.[11]</p>
        <p>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game designed for mobile phones. The game is free-to-play and is only monetized through in-game purchases like characters and skins. Each player can control a selectable character, called a Hero, with unique abilities and traits. There are six roles that define the main purpose of heroes: Tank, Marksman, Assassin, Fighter, Mage, and Support. These roles determine the responsibilities of players for their respective teams. Players can also set specific builds for heroes which include in-game items and emblems.[12]</p>
        <p>After Moonton's staff of 20 finished developing its first game called Magic Rush: Heroes, released in 2015 to commercial success, they proceeded with developing the company's next project, a mobile multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game later titled Mobile Legends. The staff's experience with engineering Magic Rush: Heroes for a global market, such as customizing its features for the differing cultures and state of telecommunications of various countries, became beneficial for them to effectively design Mobile Legends as an appealing game for global players.[19] Mobile Legends was released by Moonton with the subtitle "5v5 MOBA" on July 14, 2016.[20] The game was distributed by Elex Tech in the United States.[21] However, after the lawsuit from Riot Games in 2017, Moonton has removed the game from Google Play and re-released it as Mobile Legends: Bang Bang.[22]

Mobile Legends: Bang Bang was affected by CVE-2015-8271 (FFmpeg RTMP video streaming), a vulnerability that also affected apps like Facebook, Messenger, and SHAREit. The results suggested that the use of third-party components and open source resources, including libraries, may have led to old, vulnerable code still being present in apps.[23][24]

On July 18, 2019, Moonton announced Mobile Legends: Bang Bang 2.0 via its Epicon 2019 conference. MLBB 2.0 consists of an engine upgrade to a more recent version of the Unity game engine from version 4 to version 2017.[25][26] Moonton also promised faster loading times and start-up speed of up to 60%.[27] Other improvements of the update include reduced lag, improved character modelling, and the new in-game map "Imperial Sanctuary".[28] The update helped increase the cross-platform social media views earned by the game from 56 million in September 2019 to 76 million the next month making the game ranked fourth of all channels from all gaming brands in the US.[29]

In early 2020, the game was heavily affected by third-party plugins and scripts that allowed map-hacks prompting Moonton to publicly publish punishments made through its social media accounts revealing the account ID of the banned players.[30][31] Some accounts were also hacked due to exploits to Device ID that may have been due to the third-party scripts according to an official statement from Moonton.[32][33] In response, patch 1.4.86 enabled two-factor authentication when logging in to a new device.[34]</p>
        <p>Announced on June 5, 2020, Project NEXT was Moonton's next big project slated for Mobile Legends: Bang Bang's 5th year anniversary. This included changes in user interface, revamps to several older heroes' 3D models, skill sets, stories, and voice lines. They announced a method called "Smart Targeting" to further improve accuracy.[35] There were multiple changes that were specifically aimed at providing players with a much-improved gameplay experience, including the launch of a revamped version of the Brawl game mode. New login events, exclusive cosmetics, and a new hero was introduced with this update.[36] Project NEXT was divided into three phases: The first phase was released on September 22, 2020, the second phase was released on June 15, 2021, and the third phase was released on September 21, 2021.

The game has since crossed 1 billion downloads, with peak monthly players of 100 million.</p>
